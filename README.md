***How To Run The Code:***
You can run the cose by running the main method which as the instances of the the Routemap, readfile method, and the Search Algorithm
Moreover, I tested the program by creating the ZanzibarToAccraInputfile.csv that is been read by the readfilefile method into the Uniform Cost Search Algorithm to compute
the Shortest path, and the Number of Stops made at each instance.
